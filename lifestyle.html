      <h1>Beauty In Paris</h1>
      <p>Paris has so many places of interest, making it difficult to compress down to a reasonable number. </p>

          <h3>Petite Ceinture</h3>
          <p> the Petite Ceinture is an old railway line that once allowed freight trains to travel around 
            the French capital. Although some stretches are still in use, the line has mostly come to a halt
             and instead has given way to a multitude of welcome initiatives. Almost invisible from the road, 
             built part up high and part underground, the line has a café here (La Gare in the 16th arrondissement)
              and a canteen there (La Recyclerie in the 18th arrondissement),</p>

          <h3>Cathedral Church</h3>
          <p>Notre Dame Cathedral overlooks the Seine River from the southeastern tip of Île de la Cité.
             It’s one of the largest church buildings in the world and an exceptional example of French
              Gothic architecture. From the important Catholic relics of the cathedral treasury to the 
              splendid gargoyles and sculptures of the cathedral towers</p>
        </div>
        <div class="attractions-col">
          <img src="images/Marché des Enfants Rouges.jpg" />
          <h3>Marché des Enfants Rouges</h3>
          <p>Le Marché des Enfants Rouges (the Red Children Market) owes its quirky name to the 
            fact it was an orphanage which dressed its children in red during the 16th century. 
            It’s the oldest covered markets in Paris and one of the most popular. Here, you’ll find food
             stalls selling dishes from Italy, Africa, Lebanon – basically, from all around the world. The historical 
             importance of the place makes this market truly atmospheric. </p>
